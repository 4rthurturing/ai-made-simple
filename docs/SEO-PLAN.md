## 2. Competitor Analysis

### Top 5 Competitors

1. **Senior Planet (seniorplanet.org)** - AARP-backed. Strong authority, US-focused. Has a full AI guide PDF and regular classes. Ranks well for "AI for older adults" and "what is AI senior."

2. **BBC News AI Guide (bbc.co.uk)** - Ranks first for many UK "what is AI" queries. Massive domain authority. Not senior-specific but very accessible.

3. **Age UK / Digital Skills resources** - Trusted UK brand for older adults. Limited AI-specific content but strong domain authority for anything senior-related.

4. **TechBoomers (techboomers.com)** - Free tutorials for seniors on technology. Broad coverage but thin on AI-specific content. Good model for structure.

5. **Plain English AI (plainenglish-ai.com)** - Newer site targeting beginners with jargon-free AI education. Not age-specific but overlaps heavily on tone and approach.

### Content Gaps We Can Fill

| Gap | Competitors Missing This | Our Opportunity |
|---|---|---|
| Step-by-step ChatGPT guide for over-60s | Most guides assume younger, tech-comfortable audience | Create the definitive "How to Use ChatGPT" walkthrough with screenshots |
| AI scams targeting UK seniors | US-focused content dominates | UK-specific scam awareness (Action Fraud, UK phone scams) |
| "AI you already use" interactive content | Competitors use static articles | Our existing page is good; expand with more UK examples |
| AI and the NHS | Nobody covers this well for patients | How AI is used in the NHS, booking, triage, records |
| Family guide to helping parents with AI | Very little content here | Our /for-families page is unique; expand it |
| Video/audio content for less confident readers | Most competitors are text-only | Add audio versions of articles |
| AI for hobbies (gardening, cooking, genealogy) | Almost nobody targets this | Practical, relatable content for our audience |

## 5. Technical SEO Recommendations

### Site Speed
- Compress all images to WebP format. Target under 100KB per image.
- Enable Next.js image optimisation (next/image component with priority loading for above-the-fold images).
- Minimise JavaScript bundle size. Audit with `next build` and check bundle analyser output.
- Use static generation (SSG) for all content pages. Only /try-ai-now needs client-side rendering.
- Set Cache-Control headers for static assets (31536000 for fonts, images, CSS).

### Mobile Optimisation
- Test every page on actual devices, not just Chrome DevTools. Our audience often uses iPads and older Android phones.
- Ensure tap targets are at least 48x48px. Older users may have reduced dexterity.
- Font size minimum 18px for body text (our audience needs larger text).
- Test with screen readers (VoiceOver on iOS, TalkBack on Android).

### Schema Markup
Add structured data to every page:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "WebSite",
  "name": "Sage",
  "description": "AI explained simply for older adults",
  "url": "https://ai-made-simple-three.vercel.app"
}
```

For each article/guide page, add:
```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Article",
  "headline": "What is AI?",
  "description": "A simple explanation of artificial intelligence for beginners",
  "author": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Sage"},
  "datePublished": "2026-01-15",
  "audience": {
    "@type": "Audience",
    "audienceType": "Seniors, Older Adults"
  }
}
```

For the glossary, add DefinedTermSet schema. For FAQs on any page, add FAQPage schema (this wins featured snippets).

### Sitemap
- Generate a sitemap.xml automatically using Next.js sitemap generation.
- Add a `sitemap()` function in `app/sitemap.ts`.
- Submit to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.
- Include all public pages with `lastModified` dates.

### Robots.txt
Create `public/robots.txt`:
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /api/

Sitemap: https://ai-made-simple-three.vercel.app/sitemap.xml
```

### Core Web Vitals
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Target under 2.5s. Preload hero images. Use Next.js font optimisation for web fonts.
- **FID/INP (Interaction to Next Paint):** Target under 200ms. Minimise JavaScript on content pages.
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Target under 0.1. Set explicit width/height on all images. Avoid dynamic content injection above the fold.

### Additional Technical Items
- Set up Google Search Console and verify ownership.
- Set up Bing Webmaster Tools.
- Add canonical URLs to every page.
- Create a custom 404 page that guides lost visitors to /what-is-ai or the homepage.
- Implement Open Graph tags for social sharing (important when families share articles).
- Add a print stylesheet so articles print cleanly (our audience may prefer to print and read).

## 6. Link Building Strategy

### Types of Sites to Target

1. **Age-related charities and organisations (UK)**
   - Age UK (ageuk.org.uk)
   - Silver Line (thesilverline.org.uk)
   - Independent Age (independentage.org)
   - U3A (u3a.org.uk) - local groups often share learning resources
   - Contact them about linking to Sage as a free resource

2. **Libraries and local councils**
   - Many UK libraries run digital skills courses
   - Offer Sage as a recommended resource for their AI sessions
   - Contact library digital teams directly

3. **NHS and health information sites**
   - Once we publish the NHS/AI article, pitch it to NHS digital teams
   - Patient information sites

4. **Education and digital skills organisations**
   - Good Things Foundation (goodthingsfoundation.org)
   - Digital Unite (digitalunite.com)
   - Learn My Way (learnmyway.com)

5. **Tech publications covering accessibility**
   - Pitch "how we built an AI education site for over-60s" as a case study

### Content That Could Earn Natural Links

- **The AI Scams guide** - Highly shareable, media-friendly topic. Pitch to local newspapers and consumer shows.
- **AI Glossary** - Reference content that other sites link to when explaining terms.
- **The Family Guide** - Shareable by family members on social media and forums.
- **Free Resources roundup** - Sites listed often link back when they discover they have been featured.
- **Infographics** - Create a "Timeline of AI" or "AI in Your Home" visual. Embeddable content earns links.

### Community Engagement

- **U3A groups** - Offer free talks or workshops about AI. These groups actively seek speakers.
- **Reddit** - r/UKPersonalFinance, r/AskUK, r/elderly - share content when relevant (not spammy).
- **Facebook groups** - Many "over 50s" and "silver surfers" groups in the UK. Share articles genuinely.
- **Mumsnet** - The "elderly parents" forum is active. Share the family guide there.
- **Local newspaper letters pages** - Write about AI education for older adults, mentioning Sage.

## 7. Content Writing Guidelines for SEO

### Article Structure

Every article should follow this pattern:

1. **Opening paragraph** (2-3 sentences) - State what the article covers and why it matters. Include the primary keyword naturally.
2. **Key takeaway box** - A highlighted box at the top with the main point in one sentence.
3. **Body sections** - Use H2 headings for main sections, H3 for subsections. Keep paragraphs short (2-4 sentences max).
4. **Practical examples** - Every concept needs a real-world example the reader can relate to.
5. **Safety note** (where relevant) - A boxed reminder about staying safe.
6. **What to do next** - End with a clear call to action linking to another page on Sage.

### Word Counts

- **Core guide pages:** 1,200-1,800 words
- **Blog posts:** 1,000-1,500 words
- **Glossary entries:** 80-150 words each
- **Quick tips:** 400-600 words

Longer is not always better. Our audience values clarity over completeness. If you can say it in 1,000 words, do not pad it to 1,500.

### Using Keywords Naturally

- Include the primary keyword in the first 100 words.
- Use it in at least one H2 heading.
- Sprinkle related terms (synonyms, variations) throughout. Do not force the exact phrase repeatedly.
- Write for the reader first. If a sentence sounds odd with the keyword, rewrite it.
- Use question-based keywords as actual H2/H3 headings (e.g., "Is AI safe to use?").

### Internal Linking Rules

- Every article links to at least 2 other Sage pages.
- Link using descriptive anchor text, not "click here." Good: "read our guide to staying safe with AI." Bad: "click here for more."
- The learning path (/learn) should link sequentially through all content.
- New blog posts should link back to relevant core pages.
- Update older articles to link to newer content when published.

### Writing Style Rules

- **No em dashes.** Use commas, full stops, or brackets instead.
- **British English throughout.** Colour, organisation, programme (but "program" for software), realise, centre.
- **No AI writing tells.** Avoid: "In today's rapidly evolving landscape," "It's important to note that," "Let's dive in," "In conclusion," "Here's the thing," "Navigating the world of."
- **Short sentences.** If a sentence has more than 20 words, consider splitting it.
- **Active voice.** "AI learns from data" not "Data is learned from by AI."
- **Second person.** Write "you" not "one" or "the user."
- **Contractions are fine.** "It's," "you'll," "don't" all sound more natural.
- **Avoid hedging.** "AI can help with cooking" not "AI may potentially be able to assist with cooking activities."
- **Be specific.** "Ask ChatGPT to write a birthday message for your granddaughter" not "Use AI for various communication purposes."
- **Read it aloud.** If it sounds like a robot wrote it, rewrite it.

### Formatting for Accessibility

- Use bullet points for lists of 3+ items.
- Bold key terms on first use.
- Use simple tables only when comparing things.
- Add alt text to every image.
- Keep colour contrast high (WCAG AA minimum, AAA preferred).
- Never convey information through colour alone.
