# Sage - Brand Guidelines

## 1. Brand Overview

### Name
**Sage** - Your Friendly Guide to AI

### Tagline
"AI explained by humans, for humans."

### Mission
To make artificial intelligence approachable, understandable, and useful for older adults - empowering them to embrace technology with confidence, not fear.

### Vision
A world where no one is left behind by technology. Where age is never a barrier to understanding.

### Brand Values
1. **Patience** - We never rush. We explain things as many times as needed.
2. **Respect** - Our audience is wise. We're adding to their knowledge, not talking down.
3. **Clarity** - If it can't be said simply, it hasn't been understood well enough.
4. **Warmth** - We're a friendly neighbour, not a textbook.
5. **Honesty** - We tell the truth about AI - the good, the limitations, and the risks.

### Brand Personality
Sage is like a patient, knowledgeable friend who happens to understand technology really well. Think: the person in the family everyone calls when they need help with their phone - but without the sighing or eye-rolling.

- Warm, never cold
- Clear, never clever
- Encouraging, never condescending
- Honest, never salesy
- British, approachable

### Target Audience
- **Primary:** Adults aged 60-85
- **Secondary:** Their families who want to help them learn
- **Tertiary:** Anyone intimidated by AI/technology

## 2. Visual Identity

### Logo
The Sage logo combines a leaf icon (🌿) with clean, rounded typography. The leaf represents growth, wisdom, and the natural simplicity of the brand.

**Logo Variations:**
- **Primary:** Full logo (icon + wordmark) - for headers, hero sections
- **Secondary:** Wordmark only - for tight spaces
- **Icon:** Leaf only - for favicons, app icons, social avatars

**Clear Space:** Maintain padding equal to the height of the "S" in Sage around all sides.

**Minimum Size:** Never display the full logo smaller than 120px wide. Icon minimum: 32px.

**Contrast Requirements:** All text must meet WCAG AAA standards (7:1 contrast ratio for body text, 4.5:1 for large text). This is non-negotiable for our audience.

### Typography

#### Primary Font: Inter
- Clean, highly readable, excellent at all sizes
- Free via Google Fonts
- Designed for screens with high legibility

#### Type Scale
| Element | Size | Weight | Line Height |
|---------|------|--------|-------------|
| H1 (Page title) | 42px / 2.625rem | Bold (700) | 1.2 |
| H2 (Section) | 32px / 2rem | Semibold (600) | 1.3 |
| H3 (Subsection) | 24px / 1.5rem | Semibold (600) | 1.3 |
| Body | 20px / 1.25rem | Regular (400) | 1.7 |
| Body Large | 22px / 1.375rem | Regular (400) | 1.7 |
| Caption | 16px / 1rem | Regular (400) | 1.5 |
| Button | 20px / 1.25rem | Semibold (600) | 1 |

**Critical Rule:** Body text is NEVER smaller than 18px. Our audience needs large, clear text.

#### Font Pairing
- **Headlines:** Inter Bold/Semibold
- **Body:** Inter Regular
- **No serif fonts** - sans-serif is easier to read on screens for our audience

### Imagery Style
- **Photography:** Warm, natural lighting. Real people (diverse ages, especially older adults). No stock photo clichés of elderly people staring at screens looking confused.
- **Illustrations:** Simple, friendly line illustrations with sage green accents. Think approachable, not childish.
- **Icons:** Rounded, filled style. Minimum 24px. Clear and recognisable.
- **No:** Robots, sci-fi imagery, matrix code, or anything that reinforces AI as scary/alien.

### Spacing & Layout
- **Maximum content width:** 800px (narrow for readability)
- **Section padding:** 48px vertical minimum
- **Card padding:** 24px minimum
- **Button padding:** 16px vertical, 32px horizontal
- **Border radius:** 16px for cards, 12px for buttons (rounded = friendly)

## 3. Voice & Tone

### Brand Voice
Sage speaks like a patient, warm friend. We use:
- **Short sentences.** Like this.
- **Simple words.** "Use" not "utilise". "Help" not "facilitate".
- **Active voice.** "AI can help you write emails" not "Emails can be written with AI assistance".
- **British English.** Colour, not color. Organise, not organize.

### Tone Variations

**Educational (default):**
> "AI is a tool that learns from information. Think of it like a very knowledgeable assistant that can answer questions in plain English."

**Encouraging:**
> "You don't need to be a tech expert. If you can have a conversation, you can use AI. It's that simple."

**Reassuring:**
> "AI can't access your bank account or read your private messages. It only knows what you tell it directly."

### Language Do's and Don'ts

| ✅ Do | ❌ Don't |
|-------|---------|
| "You can ask AI to..." | "Simply leverage the AI to..." |
| "This might take a moment" | "Please wait while we process" |
| "Let's try again" | "Error: Invalid input" |
| "Think of it like..." | "Technically speaking..." |
| "That's a great question" | "As per the documentation" |
| "older adults" or "over 60s" | "elderly", "seniors", "old people" |

### Accessibility Writing Rules
1. Maximum 15 words per sentence where possible
2. One idea per paragraph
3. Use bullet points for lists (never walls of text)
4. Define any technical term the first time it appears
5. Reading level: aim for age 11-12 (Flesch-Kincaid)
