  body: `<p>If you have grandchildren, you may have seen them using AI for schoolwork, creativity, or just curiosity. It can feel confusing, especially if you aren't using it yourself.</p>

<p>This guide explains what children and teenagers are using AI for, what to watch out for, and how to talk about it calmly.</p>

<h2>What kids use AI for</h2>
<p>Many children use AI to get help with homework explanations, idea generation, or writing practice. Some use it for creative projects like stories, poems, or code for simple games.</p>

<p>Teenagers might also use AI to summarise articles or check their understanding of a topic.</p>

<h2>Why it can be useful</h2>
<p>AI can be a patient tutor that explains things in different ways. It can help a child who is stuck on a maths problem or needs help structuring an essay.</p>

<p>Used well, it can encourage curiosity. The key is to make sure it supports learning rather than replaces it.</p>

<h2>Concerns to keep in mind</h2>
<p>AI can be wrong. It can also make it too easy to copy an answer without understanding it. That's why supervision and good habits matter.</p>

<p>Privacy is another concern. Children shouldn't share personal details, school information, or photos in AI chats.</p>

<h2>How to talk about it</h2>
<p>Ask open questions rather than banning it. "What do you use it for?" and "How do you check if it's correct?" can lead to good conversations.</p>

<p>You can also suggest they show you how it works. That makes it less mysterious and helps you understand their habits.</p>

<h2>Prompts you can copy and paste</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Explain fractions in simple terms for a 10 year old."</li>
<li>"Give me three ideas for a short story about a lost dog."</li>
<li>"Help me plan a revision timetable for GCSE history."</li>
<li>"Explain this science topic like I am 12: [topic]."</li>
<li>"Create a practice quiz on the Tudors with ten questions."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Set family ground rules</h2>
<p>It helps to agree on simple rules, such as checking answers with a teacher or a trusted website, and never sharing personal details in a chat. Keep it light and supportive.</p>

<p>If your grandchildren are older, you can ask them to teach you a little. That often builds trust.</p>

<h2>Learn together</h2>
<p>One of the nicest ways to understand AI is to ask your grandchildren to teach you a little. They can show you how they ask questions and you can discuss what makes a good answer.</p>

<p>This keeps the conversation open and helps them think critically about what they are using.</p>

<h2>Set kind boundaries</h2>
<p>Keep rules simple: don't share personal details, always check answers, and be honest about what you have used AI for in schoolwork. That's more realistic than a total ban.</p>

<p>Revisit the rules now and then as the tools change.</p>

<h2>Be honest about schoolwork</h2>
<p>Most schools want students to show their own understanding. Encourage your grandchildren to use AI for explanations and practice, not for copying final answers.</p>

<p>When in doubt, checking with a teacher is the safest approach.</p>

<h2>Model good habits</h2>
<p>Children notice what adults do. If you use AI, show them how you check facts and edit drafts. It helps them learn that tools are useful but not perfect.</p>

<p>That shared habit builds critical thinking and trust.</p>
