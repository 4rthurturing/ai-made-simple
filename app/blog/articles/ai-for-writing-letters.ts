<p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong> AI can help you draft letters and emails when you feel stuck, from thank you notes to formal complaints. This guide explains that AI is strongest at structure and tone, so you should tell it who the letter is for, the outcome you want, and whether the tone should be friendly, formal, or firm. It encourages you to edit the draft so it sounds like you and to add personal details for authenticity. It also warns not to include sensitive information like addresses, account numbers, or passwords, using placeholders instead. Practical tips include asking for shorter versions, bullet points, or alternative tones, and checking names and dates before sending. You can even ask for three versions and pick the one that feels right. The main idea is that AI gives you a clean first draft, while you keep control of the final message.</p>

<p>Writing a letter can feel oddly stressful. You know what you want to say, but the first sentence won't come out, and the whole thing starts to feel too formal or too sharp.</p>

<p>AI can help you get a clean first draft without taking over your voice. Think of it as a polite neighbour who puts your thoughts into order, then hands the pen back to you.</p>

<h2>What AI is good at with letters and emails</h2>
<p>AI is strong at structure. It can open a letter, set out the main points clearly, and close in a calm, friendly way. That's handy when you need to sound respectful or keep your emotions in check.</p>

<p>It's also good at tone changes. If your draft feels too stiff, you can ask for a warmer version. If it feels too chatty, you can ask for something more formal.</p>

<h2>Start with the basics</h2>
<p>Give the AI a few details so it can help properly. Include who the letter is for, what the issue is, and what outcome you want. If you already have a couple of sentences, add them too.</p>

<p>Try writing: "I need a short email to my energy company about a high bill. I want them to check the meter." That simple context makes the result far more useful.</p>

<h2>Copy and paste prompts you can use</h2>
<p>Here are prompts you can copy and paste. Replace the bits in brackets with your own details.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Write a polite thank-you letter to my neighbour [name] for looking after my cat while I was away. Keep it warm and short."</li>
<li>"Draft a formal complaint email to [company] about [problem]. I want a refund and a written response."</li>
<li>"Write an email to my GP surgery asking for a routine appointment. Keep it clear and respectful."</li>
<li>"Help me write a letter to my landlord about [repair issue]. Explain what happened and ask for a date it will be fixed."</li>
<li>"Create a friendly email to a school teacher about my child [name] missing class on [date]."</li>
<li>"Write a short condolence message to a friend who has lost their [relative]. Keep it gentle and simple."</li>
<li>"Draft a formal letter asking my bank to close an account. Include my name and account number placeholders."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Make it sound like you</h2>
<p>AI drafts are only a starting point. Read the result out loud. If it doesn't sound like you, change a few words. Add a personal line or a memory to make it feel real.</p>

<h2>Keep it polite, even in complaints</h2>
<p>When you're upset, it's easy for a letter to sound harsh. AI can soften the tone while keeping the facts firm. That often gets a better response.</p>

<p>For example, you can ask: "Rewrite this so it's calm but still clear about what went wrong." That's often all it needs.</p>

<h2>Practical tips for better letters</h2>
<p>Ask for the format you want. Say "bullet points" if you want a list of issues, or "two short paragraphs" if you want it brief. If the response is too long, ask for a shorter version.</p>

<p>You can also ask for variations. "Give me three different versions and I will pick one." That helps when you aren't sure about the tone.</p>

<h2>What not to include</h2>
<p>Don't paste in sensitive details such as your full address, account numbers, or passwords. Use placeholders like [address] and [account number], then add them yourself later.</p>

<h2>When a human touch matters more</h2>
<p>AI can't know your feelings the way you do. If the letter is about a relationship or a life event, keep the draft but add your own line that only you could write.</p>

<p>That could be a shared memory, a gentle joke, or a small detail about the person. It makes the letter feel genuine rather than generic.</p>

<h2>A quick worked example</h2>
<p>Say you want to thank a neighbour for feeding your cat. You might write a rough note like, "Thanks for helping while I was away, you saved me." Then ask the AI: "Rewrite this as a short thank-you note, warm and friendly." It will turn your rough note into something clear.</p>

<p>Once you see the draft, add a personal detail. Mention the cat's name or a small moment you appreciated. That tiny line makes the letter feel real rather than generic.</p>

<p>If the draft feels too formal, ask it to make it more casual. If it feels too casual, ask for a more formal version. You're in charge of the final tone.</p>

<h2>Before you send it</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check the names and dates, and add any missing details</li>
<li>Make sure the tone sounds like you, not a template</li>
<li>Remove anything that feels too strong or too vague</li>
<li>Keep it short unless you need a detailed complaint</li>
<li>Read it out loud to see if it flows</li>
</ul>
