<p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong> This article offers ten practical ideas for what to ask ChatGPT, aimed at people who are not sure how to start. Examples include drafting letters and complaints, explaining complex topics in plain English, planning meals with ingredients you already have, writing card messages, understanding bills, planning trips, summarising long articles, practising a language conversation, generating gift ideas, and crafting polite but firm emails. Each use case comes with sample prompts you can copy and adjust. The article also reminds you to avoid sharing sensitive details and to double check important facts, since ChatGPT can be wrong. It encourages trying different tones and asking for shorter versions until the answer feels right. The main answer is that ChatGPT is most useful for everyday writing, planning, and explanations, and you get better results when you are specific about tone, length, and context.</p>

<p>So you've signed up for ChatGPT. You're looking at that empty text box. And you're thinking... what do I actually ask it?</p>

<p>Fair enough. It's a bit like being handed the keys to a very fancy car and not knowing where to drive. The possibilities are so open-ended that it can feel overwhelming.</p>

<p>Here are ten genuinely useful things you can ask ChatGPT today. Each one comes with the exact words to type, so you can copy them straight in. Have a go and see what happens.</p>

<h2>1. Write a Letter for You</h2>

<p>Need to write to your council about a missed bin collection? Or a thank you note after a hospital stay? ChatGPT is surprisingly good at this.</p>

<p><strong>Try typing:</strong> "Write a polite letter to my local council complaining about a missed bin collection on Monday 10th February. My address is on Elm Street. Keep it short and friendly."</p>

<p>You'll get a properly structured letter in seconds. You can then tweak it, ask ChatGPT to make it more formal or more casual, or just copy it straight into an email. One thing to note: don't include your full real address. Use a vague description and fill in the details yourself afterwards.</p>

<h2>2. Explain Something in Plain English</h2>

<p>Got a letter from your doctor with words you don't recognise? Seen something in the news that doesn't make sense? ChatGPT is brilliant at simplifying things.</p>

<p><strong>Try typing:</strong> "Can you explain what 'quantitative easing' means? Explain it like I'm chatting to a friend over a cup of tea."</p>

<p>That last bit is the trick. Telling ChatGPT <em>how</em> to explain something changes the answer completely. You could also say "explain it to a 10-year-old" or "explain it without any jargon." Experiment and see what works for you.</p>

<h2>3. Plan a Meal with What You've Got</h2>

<p>It's 5pm. You look in the fridge. There's some chicken, half a pepper, and a tin of tomatoes. Sound familiar?</p>

<p><strong>Try typing:</strong> "I have chicken breast, a red pepper, tinned tomatoes, onion, and rice. What can I make for dinner? Give me a simple recipe."</p>

<p>ChatGPT will give you a full recipe with steps. You can ask it to adjust portions, suggest a vegetarian swap, or make it quicker to cook. It's like having a very calm cooking instructor on speed dial.</p>

<h2>4. Compose a Birthday or Sympathy Message</h2>

<p>Writing the right words for a card can be surprisingly hard. Especially when it's a sympathy card or a milestone birthday.</p>

<p><strong>Try typing:</strong> "Help me write a short, heartfelt birthday message for my friend who's turning 70. She loves gardening and has a great sense of humour."</p>

<p>The more detail you give, the more personal the result. You'll probably want to tweak a word or two, but it gives you a solid starting point when the blank card is staring at you.</p>

<h2>5. Help You Understand a Bill or Statement</h2>

<p>Energy bills, bank statements, council tax letters. They're not exactly written in plain English, are they?</p>

<p><strong>Try typing:</strong> "I got my energy bill and it mentions 'standing charge' and 'unit rate'. Can you explain what each of these means and why my bill might have gone up?"</p>

<p>Just remember: don't type in your actual account numbers or personal details. Keep it general. ChatGPT can explain the <em>concepts</em> without needing your specific information.</p>

<h2>6. Get Travel Suggestions</h2>

<p>Planning a day trip? A holiday? Not sure where to start?</p>

<p><strong>Try typing:</strong> "Suggest a three-day trip to Cornwall for a retired couple in spring. We like walking but nothing too strenuous, good food, and interesting history. We'll be driving."</p>

<p>You'll get a day-by-day plan with specific suggestions. It won't book anything for you, and you should double-check opening times yourself, but it's a cracking starting point for trip planning.</p>

<h2>7. Summarise a Long Article</h2>

<p>Someone's sent you a really long article and you can't face reading all of it? ChatGPT can help.</p>

<p><strong>Try typing:</strong> "Can you summarise this article for me in about 5 bullet points?" Then paste the article text below your question.</p>

<p>This works brilliantly for news articles, health information, or those long emails from companies. You get the key points without wading through paragraphs of waffle.</p>

<h2>8. Practice a Conversation in Another Language</h2>

<p>Going on holiday and want to brush up on your French? Or Spanish? ChatGPT can have a conversation with you in almost any language.</p>

<p><strong>Try typing:</strong> "I'm going to Paris next month. Can you help me practise basic French? Start with ordering food at a restaurant. Correct my mistakes gently."</p>

<p>It'll play the role of a waiter and guide you through the conversation. Much less embarrassing than practising in front of real people. And it's endlessly patient if you get things wrong.</p>

<h2>9. Get Ideas for Gifts</h2>

<p>We've all been stuck for gift ideas. Especially for the person who "doesn't want anything."</p>

<p><strong>Try typing:</strong> "My husband is turning 68. He likes cricket, real ale, and walking the dog. He doesn't want more stuff. Can you suggest some experience-based gift ideas under fifty pounds?"</p>

<p>You'll get creative suggestions you might not have thought of. Ask follow-up questions to narrow it down. "He's based in Yorkshire" or "He's not very adventurous" will help refine the ideas.</p>

<h2>10. Write a Complaint (When You Can't Find the Words)</h2>

<p>There's something satisfying about a well-written complaint. But when you're frustrated, it's hard to be both firm and polite.</p>

<p><strong>Try typing:</strong> "Help me write a complaint email to a holiday company. Our hotel room wasn't as described, the pool was closed for the whole week, and nobody responded to our complaints at reception. I want a partial refund. Be firm but reasonable."</p>

<p>ChatGPT strikes the right tone. It'll be assertive without being rude, which is exactly what you need when you're asking for your money back.</p>

<h2>A Few Things to Keep in Mind</h2>

<p>ChatGPT is a tool, not an oracle. It's very good at generating text, brainstorming, and explaining things. It's less reliable for very specific facts, recent events, or anything that needs to be 100% accurate.</p>

<p>Always double-check important information. Don't share personal details. And remember you can always say "try again" or "give me a different version" if you're not happy with the first answer.</p>

<p>The best way to get comfortable? Just start asking things. The more you use it, the better you'll get at knowing what works.</p>
