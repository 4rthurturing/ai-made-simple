  body: `<p>Crosswords and puzzles are meant to be fun, but some clues can drive you up the wall. AI can help with hints without spoiling the whole thing.</p>

<p>Think of it as a friend who gives you a nudge rather than the full answer.</p>

<h2>How AI can help with puzzles</h2>
<p>AI can suggest synonyms, explain wordplay, and give gentle hints. It can also help you practise by creating small puzzles or word lists.</p>

<p>It's especially good for clue types like anagrams or cryptic definitions, where a bit of explanation goes a long way.</p>

<h2>Ask for hints, not answers</h2>
<p>If you want to keep the challenge, ask for a hint first. You can say, "Give me a hint without the answer." That keeps the fun alive.</p>

<p>If you're truly stuck, you can ask for the answer, but it's nice to save that as a last resort.</p>

<h2>Prompts you can copy and paste</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Give me a hint for this crossword clue without giving the answer: [clue]."</li>
<li>"Explain the wordplay in this cryptic clue: [clue]."</li>
<li>"Suggest synonyms for [word] that fit a 5 letter answer."</li>
<li>"Create a short word puzzle for me to practise."</li>
<li>"Help me solve this anagram: [letters]."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use AI to learn puzzle patterns</h2>
<p>If you enjoy cryptics, AI can explain common clue types, like anagrams, hidden words, and double definitions. That makes you better over time.</p>

<p>Ask it to show examples, then try to solve them yourself before checking the answer.</p>

<h2>Keep it light and fun</h2>
<p>AI is best used as a gentle helper. The goal is still your own enjoyment, not racing to the solution.</p>

<p>If you use AI every time, puzzles can become less satisfying. A few hints here and there can be just right.</p>

<h2>A gentle practice routine</h2>
<p>If you want to improve at cryptics, ask AI to give you one clue a day and explain the answer after you try. That slow practice builds pattern recognition over time.</p>

<p>You can also ask it to list common abbreviations used in cryptic clues, which can be a big help.</p>

<h2>Keep the fun intact</h2>
<p>AI can solve a clue fast, but that isn't the point. Use it to learn and to nudge you past a block, then return to solving on your own.</p>

<p>The aim is to enjoy the puzzle, not to finish as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2>Learn the language of puzzles</h2>
<p>You can ask AI to explain common cryptic abbreviations and indicators. That makes future clues easier to tackle without help.</p>

<p>Over time you'll rely on it less and enjoy the solving more.</p>

<h2>Build a word list</h2>
<p>Ask AI to create a list of words by theme, like birds, rivers, or musical instruments. This can help you spot answers faster when a clue points to a category.</p>

<p>It's a gentle way to improve without spoiling the puzzle itself.</p>

<h2>Use it to check, not to copy</h2>
<p>If you solve a clue and feel unsure, ask AI to confirm the wordplay. That way you learn without spoiling the rest of the grid.</p>

<h2>Celebrate small wins</h2>
<p>Solving one tricky clue with a hint still counts. Over time those small wins add up and your confidence grows.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div class="faq-section">
<h3>Will AI ruin the puzzle for me?</h3>

<h3>Can AI solve cryptic clues?</h3>
<p>It can sometimes, but it isn't perfect. It's best for learning the patterns.</p>
<h3>Is it cheating to use AI?</h3>
<p>That's up to you. Many people use a dictionary or a friend. AI can be used in the same spirit.</p>
