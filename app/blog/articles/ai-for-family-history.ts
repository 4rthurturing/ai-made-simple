<p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong> AI can support family history research by organising your notes, turning facts into timelines, and drafting warm short stories you can edit. This article explains that AI cannot access private records, but it can suggest what to search next, create question lists for relatives, and clarify old terms. It advises starting with the basics you already know, then feeding short facts to the AI. It stresses accuracy: avoid inventing details, label guesses, and double check dates and spellings. There are tips for organising files, naming scans, and keeping living relatives' privacy in mind. It also suggests using AI to explain census records or old occupations in plain English. The overall message is to use AI as a tidy, patient assistant that helps you plan and write while you remain the historian and fact checker.</p>

<p>Family history research can be fascinating, but it can also feel like a maze of dates, places, and old handwriting. AI can help you organise what you find and turn facts into stories.</p>

<p>It can't access private records, but it can guide your research and help you make sense of what you already have.</p>

<h2>Where AI fits into family history</h2>
<p>AI is good at summarising, organising, and suggesting next steps. If you have a pile of notes, it can turn them into a timeline or a simple family tree outline.</p>

<p>It can also help you draft a family story in a warm, readable way, which is lovely for sharing with relatives.</p>

<h2>Start with what you know</h2>
<p>Write down the basics you already have, like names, approximate dates, and places. Even a small amount gives the AI something to work with.</p>

<p>For example: "My grandfather was John Smith, born around 1920 in Leeds. He married Mary Brown and worked on the railways."</p>

<h2>Prompts you can copy and paste</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Turn these notes into a simple timeline: [paste notes]."</li>
<li>"Write a short family story based on these facts, keep it warm and respectful: [facts]."</li>
<li>"Suggest next records I should look for in the UK based on this person: [details]."</li>
<li>"Help me write a list of questions to ask older relatives about our family."</li>
<li>"Create a simple family tree outline from these names: [names]."</li>
<li>"Explain what a census record is in plain English."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use AI to draft questions for relatives</h2>
<p>Sometimes the hardest part is knowing what to ask. AI can suggest gentle questions that aren't too intrusive, like where someone grew up, what work they did, or what a family home was like.</p>

<p>When you interview relatives, write down their words and then ask AI to tidy the notes into a readable paragraph.</p>

<h2>Be careful with assumptions</h2>
<p>AI can fill gaps, but it shouldn't invent facts. If you ask it to write a story, tell it to stick only to the facts you provide.</p>

<p>Always mark guesses as guesses in your notes. That keeps your family history honest.</p>

<h2>A simple story template</h2>
<p>If you want a short family story, give the AI a few facts and ask it to write a paragraph. Then edit it with your own voice. This keeps the story honest while making it easy to read.</p>

<p>You can also ask it to write two versions, one formal and one informal, and choose the one that feels right.</p>

<h2>Organising your files</h2>
<p>Ask AI for a simple folder structure, like one folder per family line or per location. A tidy system saves time when you come back to the project months later.</p>

<p>It can also help you create a naming system for photos and scans so you can find them quickly.</p>

<h2>Respect living relatives</h2>
<p>If you're writing about people who are still alive, be considerate. Ask permission before sharing their stories, and avoid details they would want private.</p>

<p>AI can help you phrase things gently, but the responsibility for kindness is still yours.</p>

<h2>Check dates and spellings</h2>
<p>AI can tidy your notes, but it can also repeat a mistake if you made one. Take a moment to check dates, names, and places before you share a story.</p>

<p>That extra check keeps your family history accurate and respectful.</p>
