  body: `<p>Learning something new can feel daunting, but AI can be a gentle helper. It doesn't judge you if you ask the same question twice, and it can explain things in different ways.</p>

<p>Whether you want to learn a language, pick up a hobby, or understand a bit of computing, AI can guide you step by step.</p>

<h2>Why AI works well as a tutor</h2>
<p>It can adjust to your pace. If you want a quick summary, it can do that. If you want a longer explanation, it can do that too.</p>

<p>It can also give examples, quizzes, and practice tasks. That's useful when you want to test yourself.</p>

<h2>Pick a clear goal</h2>
<p>Start with something specific, like "learn basic Spanish for travel" or "understand how email works." Clear goals help the AI shape a plan that makes sense.</p>

<p>If your goal is vague, the AI will be vague too. The more detail you share, the better the suggestions.</p>

<h2>Prompts you can copy and paste</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Teach me the basics of Italian for a holiday, with short daily lessons."</li>
<li>"Explain how to knit a simple scarf in easy steps."</li>
<li>"Create a four week plan to learn beginner Excel."</li>
<li>"Quiz me on French greetings, one question at a time."</li>
<li>"Explain what a web browser is, like you're talking to a beginner."</li>
<li>"Give me a gentle workout plan for building strength at home."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use AI for feedback</h2>
<p>If you're learning to write, ask the AI to check your draft and suggest improvements. If you're learning a language, ask it to correct your sentences and explain why.</p>

<p>Don't worry about being perfect. The point is to practice and improve gradually.</p>

<h2>Mix AI with real practice</h2>
<p>AI can't replace real world practice. If you're learning a language, speak with people when you can. If you're learning to cook, cook. Use AI as a guide, not a substitute.</p>

<p>Small, regular practice beats long sessions once a month. Ask AI to build a simple weekly routine you can stick to.</p>

<h2>A sample weekly plan</h2>
<p>AI can build a gentle plan that fits your schedule. For example, you could ask for a four week beginner plan to learn photography. It might suggest a short lesson twice a week and one practical task at the weekend.</p>

<p>That kind of structure keeps you moving without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

<h2>Keep momentum without pressure</h2>
<p>Ask the AI to set tiny goals, like "learn five new words" or "complete one exercise." Small wins build confidence.</p>

<p>If you miss a week, don't worry. Start again and ask for a lighter plan.</p>

<h2>Check your understanding</h2>
<p>After a short lesson, ask the AI to quiz you. That makes you retrieve what you learned, which helps it stick. You can also ask it to explain any mistake in a kinder way.</p>

<p>If you prefer, ask for a mini recap in three bullet points at the end of each session.</p>

<h2>Use examples from your own life</h2>
<p>If you're learning budgeting, ask it to explain using a made up example like a weekly shop. If you're learning a language, ask for phrases you would actually use, like ordering tea or asking for directions.</p>

<p>Learning sticks better when the examples feel familiar.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div class="faq-section">
<h3>Can AI replace a teacher?</h3>
<p>Not really. It can support your learning, but a human teacher still offers feedback and experience that AI can't match.</p>
<h3>Is it OK to ask the same question again?</h3>
<p>Yes. That's one of the best parts. You can ask for another explanation without feeling awkward.</p>
<h3>How do I keep myself motivated?</h3>
<p>Ask the AI to make a simple plan with small goals. Tick them off each week and celebrate the progress.</p>
