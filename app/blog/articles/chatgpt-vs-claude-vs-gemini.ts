  body: `<p>There are now several big AI tools, and it can be hard to know where to start. ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are the names you hear most often, but they aren't the same.</p>

<p>This guide keeps it simple. It isn't about tech specs, it's about what each tool feels like in everyday use.</p>

<h2>Quick overview in plain English</h2>
<p>ChatGPT is a general helper for writing, explaining, brainstorming, and day to day tasks. It's the most well known and has a huge amount of how-to advice online.</p>

<p>Claude is also a chat based helper, and many people find it has a calm, careful tone. It's often good at summarising long text and keeping track of context.</p>

<p>Gemini is Google's AI assistant. It connects well with Google services and is easy to access if you already use Google.</p>

<h2>Access and ease of use</h2>
<p>All three have free options with limits, and paid plans for heavier use. The free versions are enough for most beginners, so you don't need to spend money to try them.</p>

<p>ChatGPT is easy to find, and there are lots of guides for it. If you want a friendly step by step, start with <a href="/blog/how-to-use-chatgpt">our ChatGPT guide</a>.</p>

<h2>Strengths you might notice</h2>
<p>ChatGPT is flexible. It handles many kinds of tasks and has a wide community of users sharing tips. If you want help with writing, travel planning, or ideas, it's a solid first pick.</p>

<p>Claude is often praised for clear, tidy writing and careful summaries. If you deal with long documents or want a gentle tone, it can be a good fit.</p>

<p>Gemini is handy if you already live inside Google apps. It can be convenient for quick questions or when you want to keep everything in one place.</p>

<h2>So which one should you start with?</h2>
<p>If you're brand new, start with ChatGPT. The simple reason is that it has the most beginner resources and the clearest path to getting useful results quickly.</p>

<p>Then try Claude for comparison. You might prefer the tone, especially if you like calm, careful answers. Try Gemini if you already use Google services and want something that feels familiar.</p>

<h2>Try the same question in each tool</h2>
<p>A good way to compare is to ask the same question in each tool and see which response you like. Here are a few you can copy.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Explain inflation like you're talking to a neighbour."</li>
<li>"Plan a three day trip to York for two people who don't drive."</li>
<li>"Write a polite email to a noisy neighbour about late night music."</li>
<li>"Give me a simple recipe using chicken, tomatoes, and pasta."</li>
<li>"Summarise this article in five short bullet points: [paste text]."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Keep your expectations realistic</h2>
<p>All AI tools sometimes get things wrong. They can also sound confident even when they are guessing. It helps to treat the answer as a starting point, then double check anything important.</p>

<p>For safety, avoid sharing personal information. Our <a href="/stay-safe">stay safe guide</a> explains what to keep private.</p>

<h2>How to compare them fairly</h2>
<p>Try the same three questions in each tool and compare the answers side by side. Look at clarity, tone, and whether the response feels useful for you. A neat answer isn't always the best answer.</p>

<p>Give each tool a fair chance. If a response is too long or too technical, ask it to adjust. That helps you see how well it takes instructions.</p>

<h2>A simple decision guide</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you want the most guides and community tips, start with ChatGPT</li>
<li>If you want a calm, careful writing style, try Claude</li>
<li>If you use Google services every day, Gemini may feel convenient</li>
<li>If you're unsure, use two tools and compare the results</li>
</ul>
