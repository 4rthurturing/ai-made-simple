<p>Want to learn more about AI but don't fancy spending money on it? Fair enough. There are plenty of genuinely free resources out there, and some of them are really good.</p>

<p>The tricky bit is sorting the useful ones from the sales pitches. So we've done that for you. Everything on this list is free, available in the UK, and suitable for people who aren't already tech experts.</p>

<h2>Online Courses You Can Do at Home</h2>

<p><strong>Elements of AI</strong> (elementsofai.com)<br/>
Built by the University of Helsinki, this is one of the best free AI courses anywhere. It explains what AI is, how it works, and what it means for society. No maths required. You work through it at your own pace, and it takes about 20 to 30 hours in total. Over a million people worldwide have completed it.</p>

<p><strong>Google AI Essentials</strong> (grow.google)<br/>
Google offers a free introductory course on AI through their Grow with Google programme. It covers the basics of how AI works and how it's used in everyday tools. It's well-made and doesn't assume any prior knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>FutureLearn</strong> (futurelearn.com)<br/>
FutureLearn has several free AI courses from UK universities. Look for "Introduction to Artificial Intelligence" by Raspberry Pi Foundation, or "AI for Everyone" which is a good general starter. Courses are free to access, though they charge if you want a certificate.</p>

<p><strong>OpenLearn by The Open University</strong> (open.edu/openlearn)<br/>
The Open University offers free taster courses on AI and digital skills. "Introduction to Machine Learning and AI" is straightforward and well-paced. You can also find broader digital skills courses if you want to build your confidence first.</p>

<h2>Guides and Websites</h2>

<p><strong>BBC Bitesize and BBC News guides</strong><br/>
The BBC has published several accessible guides to AI. Search "BBC AI guide" and you'll find plain English articles explaining what AI is and how it affects daily life. They're written for a general audience, not tech enthusiasts.</p>

<p><strong>Age UK Digital Resources</strong> (ageuk.org.uk)<br/>
Age UK has a growing collection of guides on digital skills, including some that cover AI basics. They also run local digital skills workshops. Check your local Age UK branch for what's available near you.</p>

<p><strong>Good Things Foundation</strong> (goodthingsfoundation.org)<br/>
This charity runs the National Databank and National Device Scheme. They also provide free digital skills resources through their network of community centres across the UK. Some locations offer specific AI awareness sessions.</p>

<p><strong>Sage</strong> (that's us!)<br/>
You're already here, so you know what we do. Our entire site is free, designed for over-60s, and written in plain English. Start with our <a href="/what-is-ai">What is AI?</a> page and work through the <a href="/learn">learning path</a> at your own speed.</p>

<h2>In-Person Learning</h2>

<p><strong>Your local library</strong><br/>
Libraries across the UK are running digital skills sessions, and many now include AI topics. These are usually free, run by trained volunteers, and very welcoming. Pop in and ask what's coming up, or check their website for events.</p>

<p><strong>U3A groups</strong> (u3a.org.uk)<br/>
The University of the Third Age runs local interest groups for retired people. Many branches now have technology or computing groups that cover AI. Membership is typically a few pounds a year, and individual sessions are free. It's a lovely way to learn alongside other people your age.</p>

<p><strong>Digital Unite workshops</strong> (digitalunite.com)<br/>
Digital Unite trains "Digital Champions" who help others learn tech skills. They have free resources online and sometimes run workshops through community organisations. Their guides are written for absolute beginners.</p>

<p><strong>Learn My Way</strong> (learnmyway.com)<br/>
A free website by Good Things Foundation that teaches basic digital skills. It starts from the very beginning (how to use a mouse, how to send an email) and works up to more advanced topics. Good if you want to build foundational skills before tackling AI specifically.</p>

<h2>YouTube Channels Worth Following</h2>

<p>If you prefer watching to reading, a few YouTube channels explain AI in accessible ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Simplilearn</strong> has a "What is AI" video series that uses clear language and helpful visuals</li>
<li><strong>BBC Click</strong> covers technology news including AI stories, presented in an approachable way</li>
<li><strong>Age UK's YouTube channel</strong> has some digital skills content, though AI-specific videos are still limited</li>
</ul>

<p>When searching YouTube for AI content, add "explained simply" or "for beginners" to your search. This filters out the technical stuff aimed at developers.</p>

<h2>Things to Watch Out For</h2>

<p>A few warnings about the less helpful stuff out there:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>"Free" courses that aren't really free.</strong> Some sites offer a free trial, then start charging. Always check before entering any payment details.</li>
<li><strong>Courses that try to sell you something.</strong> If a course spends more time promoting a product than teaching you, move on.</li>
<li><strong>Content that's too technical.</strong> If you're lost after the first five minutes, it's probably aimed at a different audience. Try something else. There's no shame in starting with the basics.</li>
<li><strong>Outdated information.</strong> AI moves fast. Check when the course was last updated. Anything from before 2024 might be missing important recent developments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Where to Start</h2>

<p>If you're not sure, here's a simple plan:</p>

<ol>
<li>Read through our <a href="/what-is-ai">What is AI?</a> page here on Sage</li>
<li>Have a go with <a href="/blog/how-to-use-chatgpt">ChatGPT using our beginner's guide</a></li>
<li>Try the Elements of AI course for a deeper understanding</li>
<li>Check your local library or U3A for in-person sessions if you'd like to learn with others</li>
</ol>

<p>There's no rush. Go at whatever pace suits you. And remember: the fact that you're reading this means you're already learning.</p>
