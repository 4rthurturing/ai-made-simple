  body: `<p>You might have wondered if your phone is listening to you, especially after an advert pops up for something you just talked about. It's a common worry.</p>

<p>AI doesn't magically listen to your conversations by itself. The bigger issue is how apps collect data and how ads are targeted.</p>

<h2>Why it feels like your phone is listening</h2>
<p>Ads are often based on what you search for, websites you visit, and apps you use. This can make it feel like your phone heard a private chat, even when it didn't.</p>

<p>It's unsettling, but it's usually about tracking and data, not secret microphones.</p>

<h2>What about smart speakers?</h2>
<p>Smart speakers are designed to listen for a wake word like "Alexa" or "Hey Google." They are meant to record after the wake word, not all the time.</p>

<p>Still, mistakes can happen. It's fine to review your settings and delete recordings if you want to.</p>

<h2>How AI fits into this</h2>
<p>AI helps companies analyse large amounts of data. That can improve recommendations and adverts, but it also raises privacy concerns.</p>

<p>The best approach is to limit what data you share and to check privacy settings on your devices.</p>

<h2>Simple privacy steps you can take</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check app permissions and turn off microphone access if it isn't needed</li>
<li>Review your ad settings on Google, Apple, or Facebook</li>
<li>Use a browser that blocks tracking cookies</li>
<li>Turn off voice assistants if you don't use them</li>
<li>Read privacy options on new apps before you accept</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using AI chat tools safely</h2>
<p>AI chat tools aren't listening to your microphone. You type your questions, and they answer. The main risk is sharing personal details in the chat.</p>

<p>Our <a href="/stay-safe">AI safety guide</a> explains what to avoid sharing.</p>

<h2>Where to check your settings</h2>
<p>If you're concerned, take five minutes to look at your device settings. You can see which apps have microphone access and switch it off for the ones that don't need it.</p>

<p>You can also review ad settings in your Google or Apple account. Turning off personalisation can reduce that "it's listening" feeling.</p>

<h2>Myth vs reality</h2>
<ul>
<li>Myth: AI tools secretly record your chats. Reality: chat tools respond to what you type</li>
<li>Myth: Your phone hears everything. Reality: most tracking is based on browsing and app data</li>
<li>Myth: You can't change this. Reality: privacy settings give you real control</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reduce tracking without stress</h2>
<p>You don't have to change everything at once. Start by turning off personalised ads and clearing app permissions you don't need. That alone can make a big difference.</p>

<p>If you want to go further, use a private browsing mode for sensitive searches.</p>

<h2>Other devices in the home</h2>
<p>Smart TVs and streaming boxes can also collect viewing data. If that worries you, check the privacy settings and turn off personalised recommendations.</p>

<p>Small changes across a few devices can make your digital life feel calmer.</p>

<h2>Review and delete recordings</h2>
<p>Many voice assistants keep a history you can delete. If that makes you more comfortable, clear it now and then.</p>

<h2>Look for privacy labels</h2>
<p>App stores often show what data an app collects. It is worth a quick glance before you install something new.</p>
