  body: `<p>Claude is an AI assistant made by a company called Anthropic. It's designed to be helpful, polite, and careful with how it responds.</p>

<p>Many people like it for writing and summarising because the tone is calm and clear.</p>

<h2>What Claude does well</h2>
<p>Claude is good at summarising long text, organising notes, and drafting messages in a gentle tone. It often feels steady and measured, which can be reassuring.</p>

<p>It can also help you plan tasks, like a trip or a weekly schedule.</p>

<h2>What Claude can't do</h2>
<p>It doesn't access your personal files or bank details. It only knows what you type into the chat.</p>

<p>Like any AI, it can be wrong. Always check important details.</p>

<h2>How to start using Claude</h2>
<p>You open the chat, type your question, and wait for the response. If you want a shorter answer, ask for a shorter answer. If you want it simpler, say so.</p>

<p>You can also paste a long piece of text and ask it to summarise or tidy it.</p>

<h2>Prompts you can copy and paste</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Summarise this article in five bullet points: [paste text]."</li>
<li>"Rewrite this email so it sounds warmer: [paste draft]."</li>
<li>"Explain this topic in simple terms for a beginner: [topic]."</li>
<li>"Create a simple plan for a weekend trip to Bath."</li>
<li>"Turn these notes into a clear paragraph: [paste notes]."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Claude vs ChatGPT</h2>
<p>Both tools are useful for everyday tasks. ChatGPT has many guides and community examples. Claude often feels a bit more measured in tone.</p>

<p>It's worth trying both. You may prefer one for writing and the other for quick questions.</p>

<h2>Keep your details private</h2>
<p>Don't share private information like passwords or bank details. Use placeholders and add personal details later.</p>

<p>Our <a href="/stay-safe">staying safe guide</a> explains what to avoid.</p>

<h2>When Claude shines</h2>
<p>Claude is often a good choice when you have a long document and want a clear summary. It can also help you rewrite something gently, which is useful for emails or letters.</p>

<p>If you like a calm, measured tone, you may prefer its style.</p>

<h2>Try a short practice chat</h2>
<p>Paste a paragraph and ask Claude to summarise it in three bullet points. Then ask it to expand on one of those points. This shows how well it keeps context.</p>

<p>If the answer is too long, ask it to shorten it. It will usually respond well.</p>

<h2>Know the limits</h2>
<p>Claude is helpful for drafts and summaries, but it can still make mistakes. Use it as a helper, then check anything important.</p>

<p>That balance keeps you in control of the final result.</p>

<h2>Try it with longer text</h2>
<p>If you have a long email thread or a set of notes, Claude can often turn it into a neat summary. That can save time when you're feeling overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Ask it to list the main points and any open questions.</p>

<h2>Pair it with your own notes</h2>
<p>Claude is best when you give it a bit of context. A short list of your main points helps it produce a clearer summary or draft.</p>

<h2>Keep the final say</h2>
<p>If you use Claude for letters or summaries, read the final text yourself. A quick read keeps it accurate and in your voice.</p>
