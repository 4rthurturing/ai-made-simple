  body: `<p>Cooking can feel like a puzzle, especially when the fridge is half full and you aren't sure what goes together. AI can help you turn those odds and ends into a proper meal.</p>

<p>You still do the cooking, but the AI can save you time and spark ideas you might not have thought of.</p>

<h2>What AI can do for recipes</h2>
<p>AI is good at combining ingredients, adjusting portion sizes, and suggesting swaps if you're missing something. It can also offer ideas for dietary needs like vegetarian, gluten-free, or low sugar.</p>

<p>If you like a certain style of food, tell it. "Something like a curry" or "a simple pasta" gives it a useful direction.</p>

<h2>Start with what you already have</h2>
<p>Open the fridge, look in the cupboard, and list what you actually want to use up. The more specific you're, the less likely you're to get a recipe that needs a last minute dash to the shops.</p>

<p>Try: "I have chicken thighs, carrots, onions, and a tin of tomatoes." That's enough for a solid dinner idea.</p>

<h2>Copy and paste prompts you can use</h2>
<p>Here are prompts you can lift straight into your AI chat.</p>
<ul>
<li>"I have [ingredients]. Give me a simple dinner for two with clear steps."</li>
<li>"Make a vegetarian recipe using [ingredients]. Keep it under 30 minutes."</li>
<li>"Create a low-salt recipe for [dish] that still tastes good."</li>
<li>"I need a gluten-free lunch idea using [ingredients]."</li>
<li>"Scale this recipe for 6 people instead of 2: [paste recipe]."</li>
<li>"Give me a shopping list for a week of easy dinners for one."</li>
<li>"Suggest three sauces I can make with [ingredients]."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adjusting portions without the headache</h2>
<p>AI is great at portion maths. You can say, "This recipe is for four, make it for two." It will adjust the ingredient amounts for you.</p>

<p>Still, use common sense. It might say "half an egg," which isn't helpful. That's when you decide to use one and accept a slightly larger omelette.</p>

<h2>Dietary needs and swaps</h2>
<p>If you have allergies or preferences, say so early. "No nuts," "no dairy," or "low sugar" should be part of the first prompt. AI can also suggest substitutes like oat milk or lentils.</p>

<p>When it suggests something you can't find, ask for alternatives. "Give me a version with ingredients from a small UK supermarket."</p>

<h2>Check the basics</h2>
<p>AI doesn't taste food. It can also make mistakes, like forgetting a key step or suggesting a cooking time that seems too short. Read through the recipe before you start.</p>

<p>If you're unsure, ask a follow-up question. "What temperature should the oven be?" or "How do I know the chicken is cooked?"</p>

<h2>Make it your own</h2>
<p>The best recipes are often the ones you tweak. Use AI for the outline, then add a splash of lemon, a bit more garlic, or a favourite spice.</p>

<p>If you like a recipe, save it or ask the AI to format it neatly so you can print it.</p>

<h2>Example: use up odds and ends</h2>
<p>Imagine you have half a pack of mince, a tin of beans, and a few peppers. You could ask: "Make a simple one pan dinner using mince, beans, peppers, and onions. No spicy heat, serves three." The AI will often suggest a chilli style dish, but you can say, "Make it milder and add rice."</p>

<p>If the recipe includes something you don't have, ask for a swap. AI is good at finding substitutes like lentils for mince or yoghurt for cream.</p>

<h2>Kitchen common sense still matters</h2>
<p>AI doesn't know your oven or your hob. If a time feels too short, cook for longer. If you aren't sure about food safety, check a trusted guide.</p>

<p>Think of AI as a cookery book that talks back. It gives ideas, and you adjust to your kitchen and your taste.</p>
