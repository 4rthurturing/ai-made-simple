<p>Your phone rings. It sounds like your grandson. He's panicking, says he's been in an accident, needs money urgently. Your instinct is to help. That's what any caring grandparent would do.</p>

<p>But what if it wasn't actually your grandson?</p>

<p>AI can now clone someone's voice from just a few seconds of audio. Scammers are using this technology to make phone calls that sound exactly like a family member, a friend, or even your bank. It's alarming, but there are ways to protect yourself.</p>

<h2>How Does Voice Cloning Actually Work?</h2>

<p>Voice cloning software takes a recording of someone's voice and learns how they speak. The rhythm, the pitch, the little quirks. It then generates new speech in that same voice, saying whatever the scammer wants it to say.</p>

<p>Where do they get the recordings? Social media, mostly. A video your grandchild posted on TikTok or Instagram. A voicemail greeting. Even a brief clip from a public event. A few seconds is often enough.</p>

<p>The technology used to cost thousands and take hours of recordings. Now it's cheap, fast, and scarily good.</p>

<h2>The "Grandparent Scam" and How It Works</h2>

<p>This is the most common version. Here's how it typically plays out:</p>

<ol>
<li>You get a phone call from what sounds like a family member</li>
<li>They're distressed. Maybe they've been arrested, been in a car crash, or are stranded somewhere</li>
<li>They beg you not to tell anyone else (this isolates you from people who might spot the scam)</li>
<li>They ask you to transfer money immediately, buy gift cards, or hand cash to someone who'll come to your door</li>
</ol>

<p>The urgency is deliberate. Scammers want you acting on emotion, not logic. They don't want you to stop, think, or check.</p>

<h2>Red Flags to Watch For</h2>

<p>Even the best voice clones have tells. Here's what should make you pause:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Urgency and secrecy.</strong> "Don't tell Mum" or "I need this NOW." Real emergencies rarely come with instructions to keep quiet.</li>
<li><strong>They called you.</strong> If it's really your grandson, hang up and call them back on the number you already have saved. A scammer's cloned voice can't answer your grandson's real phone.</li>
<li><strong>The voice sounds slightly off.</strong> Maybe the pace is a bit robotic, or there's an odd echo. Trust your gut. If something feels wrong, it probably is.</li>
<li><strong>They ask for unusual payment methods.</strong> Gift cards, cryptocurrency, bank transfers to unfamiliar accounts. These are scam payment methods. Full stop.</li>
<li><strong>Background noise seems fake.</strong> Some scammers add artificial background noise to make the call sound more realistic. If the "hospital" sounds like a stock sound effect, be wary.</li>
<li><strong>They can't answer personal questions.</strong> Ask something only the real person would know. Not their birthday (scammers can find that online), but something specific. "What did we have for dinner when you visited last Sunday?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to Do if You Get a Suspicious Call</h2>

<p>First and most important: don't panic. That's exactly what the scammer wants.</p>

<p><strong>Hang up.</strong> Yes, it feels rude. But it's the safest thing to do. If it really is your grandson, they'll understand.</p>

<p><strong>Call the person directly.</strong> Use the phone number you already have for them. Don't use any number the caller gives you. If they answer and are completely fine, you've just dodged a scam.</p>

<p><strong>Tell someone.</strong> Don't sit with this on your own. Tell a family member, a friend, or a neighbour. Scammers rely on you staying quiet.</p>

<p><strong>Report it.</strong> In the UK, contact Action Fraud on <strong>0300 123 2040</strong> or visit <strong>actionfraud.police.uk</strong>. You can also call <strong>159</strong> (the stop scams helpline) if you think your bank might be involved.</p>

<h2>A Family Code Word</h2>

<p>This is one of the best defences. Agree on a code word with your family. Something random that wouldn't appear on social media. "Pineapple" or "Wellington boots" or whatever takes your fancy.</p>

<p>If someone calls claiming to be a family member and asking for money, ask for the code word. A real family member will know it. A scammer won't.</p>

<p>Some families change their code word every few months, just to be safe. It takes two minutes to set up and could save you thousands.</p>

<h2>It's Not Just Phone Calls</h2>

<p>Voice cloning is also being used in voicemails and even video calls. There have been cases where scammers used AI to create a video of a "boss" on a work call, instructing an employee to transfer money.</p>

<p>The principle is the same regardless of the format. If someone is asking you for money or personal details and you weren't expecting it, verify independently before doing anything.</p>

<h2>Don't Feel Embarrassed</h2>

<p>If you've been targeted by one of these scams, please don't feel silly. These are sophisticated operations run by criminals who do this full-time. They've fooled police officers, bank managers, and tech professionals. There's no shame in it.</p>

<p>What matters is reporting it so others can be warned. Action Fraud uses your reports to track patterns and catch the people behind them.</p>

<h2>Protecting Yourself Going Forward</h2>

<p>A few practical steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Set up the family code word (seriously, do this today)</li>
<li>Be cautious about what you share publicly on social media. Voice clips and videos are raw material for scammers</li>
<li>If your phone shows "unknown number" or a number you don't recognise, let it go to voicemail. Genuine callers will leave a message</li>
<li>Talk to older or more vulnerable family members about these scams. Awareness is the single best defence</li>
</ul>

<p>AI voice scams are real and getting more convincing. But so are the ways to spot them. Stay calm, verify everything, and don't let urgency override your judgement.</p>
