  body: `<p>Gardening is full of small questions. Is this plant too much sun, is the soil too dry, and what is that tiny insect on the leaves. AI can be a handy helper when you want quick guidance.</p>

<p>It won't replace local knowledge or a good garden centre, but it can save you time and help you learn as you go.</p>

<h2>What AI can help with in the garden</h2>
<p>AI can suggest what to plant in a particular month, explain why a plant looks unhappy, and offer basic pest control tips. It can also help you plan a small garden or balcony setup.</p>

<p>If you're new to gardening, it can explain terms like "hardening off" or "mulch" in plain English.</p>

<h2>Ask about your location and season</h2>
<p>Gardening advice changes depending on where you live. Tell the AI your general area and the time of year. "North of England in March" is enough to get useful seasonal advice.</p>

<p>If you want to grow a specific plant, name it and say whether it's in the ground or a pot.</p>

<h2>Prompts you can copy and paste</h2>
<ul>
<li>"I live in the south of England. What vegetables can I sow in April?"</li>
<li>"My tomato leaves are curling and yellowing. What are common causes?"</li>
<li>"Suggest low maintenance plants for a small sunny balcony."</li>
<li>"How do I improve clay soil for a flower bed?"</li>
<li>"Give me a simple plan for a beginner herb garden in pots."</li>
<li>"What are gentle ways to deal with aphids on roses?"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use photos carefully</h2>
<p>Some AI tools can analyse a photo and suggest plant or pest ideas. If you use that feature, treat it as a clue rather than a diagnosis. A local garden centre or a plant book is still a good cross check.</p>

<p>A clear photo in good light works better than a quick blurry snap.</p>

<h2>Simple garden planning with AI</h2>
<p>If you want to plan a bed or border, ask AI to suggest a mix of heights, colours, and flowering times. It can help you avoid a border that blooms for only two weeks and then fades.</p>

<p>You can also ask for plants that suit your time and energy. Say "low maintenance" or "drought tolerant" if that's important.</p>

<h2>Keep expectations realistic</h2>
<p>AI can make suggestions, but local conditions matter more. Soil type, wind, and sunlight can change things. Use AI as a starting point, then observe what happens in your own garden.</p>

<p>When in doubt, test one plant before you buy ten.</p>

<h2>A simple seasonal example</h2>
<p>Let's say it's early spring and you want to start growing vegetables. You can ask for a short list of hardy crops for your area, then ask for a week by week plan for sowing and thinning.</p>

<p>If you aren't sure where to start, ask for a list of low effort plants. That way you get early wins, which makes gardening more enjoyable.</p>

<h2>A gentle care routine</h2>
<ul>
<li>Check soil moisture once or twice a week</li>
<li>Water in the morning when possible</li>
<li>Remove dead leaves to reduce pests</li>
<li>Take a quick photo if a plant looks unwell and compare later</li>
<li>Keep notes about what worked so you can repeat it next year</li>
</ul>
