  body: `<p>AI voice cloning has made scam phone calls more convincing. You might hear a voice that sounds like a relative or a trusted company, and it can be unsettling.</p>

<p>The good news is that there are simple ways to protect yourself and your family. This guide explains what to look for and what to do.</p>

<h2>How AI scam calls work</h2>
<p>Scammers can use short audio clips from social media or past calls to mimic a voice. Then they call and create a sense of urgency, such as a sudden emergency or a request for money.</p>

<p>They rely on panic. If you slow the conversation down, you're already safer.</p>

<h2>Warning signs to watch for</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pressure to act quickly or keep it secret</li>
<li>Requests for money, gift cards, or bank transfers</li>
<li>A story that doesn't quite add up</li>
<li>Unusual contact times, like very late at night</li>
<li>Refusal to answer basic questions</li>
</ul>

<h2>What to do if you get a suspicious call</h2>
<p>Hang up and call back using a number you trust. If the caller claims to be a family member, phone them directly. If it's a bank or company, use the number on their official website or on the back of your card.</p>

<p>You can also create a family code word that only close relatives know. If someone can't answer it, treat the call as suspicious.</p>

<h2>Prompts you can copy and paste</h2>
<p>AI chat tools can help you create a plan or a message for your family.</p>
<ul>
<li>"Write a simple family plan for handling scam phone calls."</li>
<li>"Create a short checklist for spotting scam calls."</li>
<li>"Draft a message I can send to relatives about voice cloning scams."</li>
<li>"Explain voice cloning in simple terms for older adults."</li>
<li>"Suggest a safe family code word system."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Use your bank's official channels</h2>
<p>Banks won't ask you to move money to a safe account over the phone. If someone asks you to do that, hang up and call your bank using an official number.</p>

<p>Don't be embarrassed if you feel unsure. Scams are designed to trick people. Asking for help is a smart move.</p>

<h2>A family safety plan</h2>
<p>Agree on a simple plan with relatives. Decide that you'll always call back on a trusted number before sending money or sharing details. A code word can help, but the call back rule is the main safety net.</p>

<p>Write the plan down and keep it near the phone. That way you don't have to think in a stressful moment.</p>

<h2>What to do after a scam call</h2>
<p>If you think you were targeted, tell your bank as soon as possible. Change passwords and keep an eye on your accounts. Reporting it helps others too.</p>

<p>Being cautious isn't overreacting. Scams are becoming more convincing, so it's sensible to slow down and verify.</p>

<h2>Protect your online presence</h2>
<p>Keep social media profiles private where you can, and avoid posting long clear audio clips publicly. The less public voice data there's, the safer you're.</p>

<p>It's also wise to keep voicemail greetings short and simple.</p>

<h2>After a scare</h2>
<p>Even if you didn't lose money, scam calls can be upsetting. Talk to someone you trust and make a note of what happened. That can help you feel more in control.</p>

<p>If you want, write down a short script you can use next time, like "I don't discuss money on the phone. I will call you back."</p>
