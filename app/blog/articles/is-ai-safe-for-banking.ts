  body: `<p>People often ask if AI is safe for online banking. It's a sensible worry, especially when you see headlines about scams and fake messages.</p>

<p>The short answer is that your bank uses AI, but that's different from you using a public AI chat tool. Let's break it down in a simple way.</p>

<h2>How banks use AI</h2>
<p>Banks use AI behind the scenes to spot unusual spending, flag suspicious logins, and reduce fraud. This kind of AI is part of their own systems, not something you chat to.</p>

<p>It's similar to a security guard that watches patterns. It doesn't replace your bank, it helps your bank protect you.</p>

<h2>How public AI tools are different</h2>
<p>Chat tools like ChatGPT are designed to answer questions and help with writing. They aren't connected to your bank account, and they don't move money for you.</p>

<p>That also means they can't check your balance or verify a payment. If any website claims it can do that, be very cautious.</p>

<h2>What you can safely use AI for</h2>
<p>You can use AI to explain banking terms, help you write a complaint letter, or draft a message to your bank. It can also help you understand a statement in plain English.</p>

<p>For example, you might ask: "Explain what an overdraft fee is in simple words." That's safe and useful.</p>

<h2>What you should never share</h2>
<p>Never type your card number, PIN, online banking password, or full address into an AI chat. If you need help writing to your bank, use placeholders like [account number].</p>

<h2>Spotting fake messages</h2>
<p>Scammers sometimes use AI to write convincing emails or texts. A message might look polite and professional, but it can still be fake.</p>

<p>If you get a message asking you to "verify" your details, don't click the link. Go to your bank's official app or website instead. If you're unsure, call the number on the back of your card.</p>

<h2>Can AI steal your bank details?</h2>
<p>AI can't steal anything on its own. The risk comes from people sharing sensitive details or clicking on fake links. The safest approach is to keep personal data out of AI chats and be cautious with messages that pressure you.</p>

<h2>Using AI to write a message to your bank</h2>
<p>If you need to write a complaint or ask a question, AI can help. Just keep the details generic and add the private bits yourself later.</p>

<ul>
<li>"Write a polite email to my bank asking about a charge I don't recognise."</li>
<li>"Draft a letter requesting a refund of a bank fee, keep it calm and clear."</li>
<li>"Help me write a short message to close my account, include a placeholder for my account number."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Safer ways to use AI for money questions</h2>
<p>AI is useful for explaining terms like overdrafts, interest, or credit scores. It's also fine for drafting a complaint letter or a request for a fee refund. Keep the facts general and add your personal details later.</p>

<p>If you want to learn about budgeting, AI can offer simple templates or a checklist. That's low risk and often quite helpful.</p>

<h2>Red flags to watch for</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any message that asks you to move money quickly</li>
<li>A request for full login details or a one time passcode</li>
<li>Links that look strange or don't match the official site</li>
<li>Calls that pressure you to stay on the line</li>
<li>Messages that ask you to keep the issue secret</li>
</ul>
