<p>You've heard people talking about ChatGPT. Maybe your grandchildren mentioned it, or you saw it on the BBC. But what actually <em>is</em> it, and how do you get started?</p>

<p>ChatGPT is a free tool you can use on your computer, tablet, or phone. You type a question or request, and it writes back to you. Think of it like having a very patient helper who never gets tired of your questions. It won't judge you, and you can't break it.</p>

<p>This guide will walk you through everything, step by step. No rush. Go at your own pace.</p>

<h2>What You'll Need Before You Start</h2>

<p>Not much, honestly. You'll need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A computer, tablet, or smartphone with internet access</li>
<li>An email address</li>
<li>About ten minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it. You don't need to download anything special, and you don't need to pay. The free version does plenty.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Go to the ChatGPT Website</h2>

<p>Open your web browser (that's Safari, Chrome, or whatever you use to go online). In the address bar at the top, type <strong>chat.openai.com</strong> and press Enter.</p>

<p>You'll see a simple page with an option to sign up or log in. If this is your first time, click <strong>"Sign up"</strong>.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Create Your Account</h2>

<p>You'll be asked for your email address and to create a password. Pick something you'll remember, or write it down somewhere safe. You can also sign up using your Google account if you have one, which saves a step.</p>

<p>They'll send a confirmation email. Pop into your inbox, find the email from OpenAI, and click the link. Done.</p>

<p>One thing that catches people out: sometimes the confirmation email lands in your spam or junk folder. If you don't see it after a minute, have a look there.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Type Your First Question</h2>

<p>Once you're logged in, you'll see a text box at the bottom of the screen. That's where you type. It really is that simple.</p>

<p>Try something like:</p>

<blockquote>"Can you explain what artificial intelligence is in simple terms?"</blockquote>

<p>Press Enter (or tap the little arrow button), and wait a few seconds. ChatGPT will start typing back to you. You'll see the words appear on screen as if someone were typing them in real time.</p>

<p>Here's what actually matters: you can't ask a wrong question. If ChatGPT doesn't understand, it'll ask you to rephrase. If it gives you too technical an answer, just say "Can you explain that more simply?" and it will.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Have a Conversation</h2>

<p>ChatGPT remembers what you've said during your conversation. So you can ask follow-up questions without repeating yourself.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>You: "What's a good recipe for a Victoria sponge?"</li>
<li>ChatGPT gives you a recipe</li>
<li>You: "Can you make that for 6 people instead of 8?"</li>
<li>ChatGPT adjusts the quantities</li>
</ul>

<p>It's like chatting with someone who's paying close attention. You don't need to start from scratch each time you ask something new in the same conversation.</p>

<h2>What Can You Actually Ask It?</h2>

<p>Quite a lot, really. Here are some ideas to get you going:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Write something for you.</strong> "Write a thank you letter to my neighbour for looking after my cat."</li>
<li><strong>Explain things.</strong> "What does 'inflation' mean in plain English?"</li>
<li><strong>Help with planning.</strong> "Plan a three-day trip to the Lake District for two people who don't drive."</li>
<li><strong>Get recipe ideas.</strong> "What can I make for dinner with chicken, potatoes, and broccoli?"</li>
<li><strong>Translate text.</strong> "How do you say 'where is the train station' in French?"</li>
<li><strong>Settle a debate.</strong> "What year was the first mobile phone call made?"</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll be surprised how useful it is once you start experimenting. The more specific you are with your question, the better the answer.</p>

<h2>Tips for Getting Better Answers</h2>

<p>ChatGPT works best when you give it a bit of context. Compare these two questions:</p>

<p><strong>Vague:</strong> "Tell me about gardening."</p>
<p><strong>Better:</strong> "I'm a beginner gardener in the north of England. What vegetables can I plant in March?"</p>

<p>The second question gets you a much more useful answer because ChatGPT knows your situation.</p>

<p>A few more tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the answer is too long, say "Can you give me a shorter version?"</li>
<li>If you want a list, ask for one: "Give me a bullet-point list of..."</li>
<li>If something seems wrong, ask it to double-check: "Are you sure about that?"</li>
<li>You can ask it to change the tone: "Rewrite that in a more friendly way"</li>
</ul>

<h2>What NOT to Tell ChatGPT</h2>

<p>This is really important. ChatGPT is helpful, but it's not private in the way a conversation with your doctor is. Don't share:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your full name and address together</li>
<li>Bank details, card numbers, or PINs</li>
<li>Your NHS number or National Insurance number</li>
<li>Passwords</li>
</ul>

<p>Think of it this way: don't type anything you wouldn't write on a postcard. For more on this, have a read of our <a href="/stay-safe">guide to staying safe with AI</a>.</p>

<h2>When ChatGPT Gets Things Wrong</h2>

<p>It will sometimes. ChatGPT is very good at sounding confident, even when it's making things up. This is called a "hallucination" in AI terms, which is a fancy way of saying it's guessed and got it wrong.</p>

<p>It's particularly unreliable with very recent news, specific statistics, and anything involving real people's personal details. Use it as a starting point, not the final word. If something matters (like medical or legal information), always check with a proper source.</p>

<p>But for everyday tasks like drafting letters, brainstorming ideas, or explaining concepts? It's genuinely brilliant.</p>

<h2>Starting a New Conversation</h2>

<p>After you've been chatting for a while, you might want to start fresh. Look for a button that says <strong>"New chat"</strong> (usually in the top left corner or sidebar). This clears the slate so ChatGPT forgets your previous conversation and starts from scratch.</p>

<p>This is useful when you want to ask about something completely different. You don't <em>have</em> to start a new chat, but it can help keep things tidy.</p>

<h2>Using ChatGPT on Your Phone</h2>

<p>There's an app for both iPhones and Android phones. Search for "ChatGPT" in the App Store or Google Play Store. Make sure it's the official one by OpenAI (there are copycats).</p>

<p>The app works exactly the same way as the website. You can even talk to it using your voice instead of typing, which some people find easier.</p>

<h2>Don't Worry About Getting It Perfect</h2>

<p>The best way to learn ChatGPT is to just have a go. You won't break anything, and there's no one watching. If you type something silly, so what? Delete the chat and move on.</p>

<p>In my experience, people who try ChatGPT for the first time are usually surprised by how easy it is. The hardest part is just getting started.</p>

<p>So pop over to <strong>chat.openai.com</strong>, sign up, and ask it something. Anything. "What should I have for dinner tonight?" is a perfectly good first question.</p>
