<p><strong>Quick Summary:</strong> This article lists seven common beginner mistakes with AI and how to avoid them. It explains that vague prompts, missing goals, and unclear tone produce weak answers, and suggests adding simple context like who the answer is for, length, and purpose. It warns against trusting AI instantly, especially for health, money, or legal topics, and reminds you to double check facts. It also stresses privacy: never share passwords, bank details, or full addresses. Other tips include asking follow up questions, treating AI output as a draft, and restarting a chat if it gets messy. The article provides practice prompts, a before and after example, and a quick checklist to improve results. It also suggests keeping a small prompt notebook of wording that works. The core message is that small changes in how you ask make AI far more useful and safe.</p>

<p>AI is helpful, but it's easy to trip up when you're new. A few small mistakes can make the answers worse or even risky.</p>

<p>Here are seven common mistakes and how to avoid them, explained in plain English.</p>

<h2>1. Being too vague</h2>
<p>If you ask, "Tell me about gardening," the AI doesn't know what you want. Add context like your location, time of year, or experience level.</p>

<h2>2. Giving no goal</h2>
<p>AI needs a purpose. Instead of "Write about pensions," say "Write a short explanation of pensions for a beginner in the UK."</p>

<h2>3. Trusting everything instantly</h2>
<p>AI can sound confident while being wrong. Use it as a starting point and check facts that matter, especially for health, money, or legal topics.</p>

<h2>4. Sharing private information</h2>
<p>Don't type in passwords, bank details, or full addresses. Use placeholders like [account number] and add them later.</p>

<h2>5. Forgetting to ask for a tone</h2>
<p>If you want something friendly, formal, or short, say so. AI is good at matching tone, but it needs a hint.</p>

<h2>6. Not asking follow up questions</h2>
<p>Many people stop after the first answer. Ask follow ups like "Can you make it shorter?" or "Explain that with an example."</p>

<h2>7. Expecting it to be perfect</h2>
<p>AI drafts are just that, drafts. Treat them like a first attempt, then edit and improve in your own words.</p>

<h2>Prompts to practise with</h2>
<ul>
<li>"Explain AI in simple terms and keep it under 100 words."</li>
<li>"Write a polite email asking for a refund. Keep it calm and clear."</li>
<li>"Summarise this text in three bullet points: [paste text]."</li>
<li>"Give me three ideas for a low cost day out in the UK."</li>
<li>"Rewrite this so it sounds warmer: [paste draft]."</li>
</ul>

<h2>A before and after example</h2>
<p><strong>Before:</strong> "Help me write about pensions."</p>
<p><strong>After:</strong> "Write a short explanation of pensions for someone in the UK who has never had one. Keep it friendly and under 150 words."</p>

<p>That tiny change makes the response much more useful, and it takes only a few seconds to do.</p>

<h2>A quick checklist for better results</h2>
<ul>
<li>Say who the answer is for</li>
<li>Say the goal in one clear sentence</li>
<li>Ask for the tone you want</li>
<li>Include limits like length or budget</li>
<li>Ask a follow up if it isn't right</li>
</ul>

<h2>One extra habit that helps</h2>
<p>Give a small example when you can. If you want a tone, share one sentence that already sounds right. The AI will mirror it.</p>

<p>This tiny step can save you lots of back and forth, especially for emails and letters.</p>

<h2>A gentle reset when it feels messy</h2>
<p>If a chat gets confusing, start a new one and restate the goal clearly. It can feel like wiping a slate clean, and the answers often improve.</p>

<p>AI is very forgiving, so it's fine to restart and try again.</p>

<h2>Keep a tiny prompt notebook</h2>
<p>If you find a prompt that works well, save it. Over time you build your own small set of prompts that fit your needs, which makes AI faster and less frustrating.</p>

<h2>Shorter prompts can still work</h2>
<p>You don't need a long prompt. A clear one or two sentences with a goal and tone can be enough to get a strong answer.</p>
